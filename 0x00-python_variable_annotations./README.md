Python Variable Annotations

This repository contains code for the Python Variable Annotations project on the ALX platform. It explores the use of type hints in Python 3 for improved code clarity and static type checking.

Learning Objectives

Understand type annotations in Python 3.
Use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types.
Explore duck typing concepts.
Validate code with mypy.
Project Structure

The project consists of several Python files, each addressing a specific task related to type annotations. Each file focuses on a single function and resides in a separate directory named according to the task number (e.g., 0x00-python_variable_annotations/0-add.py).

Tasks

The project includes the following tasks:

Basic Annotations: Implement type-annotated functions for addition, concatenation, floor calculation, and float conversion.
Defining Variables: Define and annotate variables with specific data types (integer, float, boolean, and string).
Complex Types: Create functions that handle lists of floats, mixed lists (integers and floats), and converting string-integer/float pairs to tuples.
Functions as Types: Implement a function that generates another function as its return value.
Duck Typing: Annotate a function that works with any iterable object containing sequences.
Running the Tests

The provided code snippets primarily demonstrate functionality. Additional testing frameworks or manual verification might be necessary for a more robust solution.
